#This project is a face detection and emotion analysis application developed using Python, OpenCV, and DeepFace. It detects faces from camera input, saves the detected faces, and performs emotion analysis.The code is designed to perform the following functions:

#Face Detection:Real-time face detection is performed using Haar Cascade Classifier from OpenCV.Rectangles are drawn around the detected faces.

#Emotion Analysis: The DeepFace library is used to analyze emotions (e.g., happy, sad, fearful).The identified emotions are displayed on the screen.

#Saving Face Images:Detected faces are saved in the detected_faces folder, with each face automatically numbered.

#Real-Time Image Processing: Camera frames are continuously processed.
The number of faces and their emotional states are displayed in real-time.

#User Control:You can exit the application by pressing the q key.

#How to Run the Project: Follow these steps to run the project

#Install Dependencies:
Ensure the following libraries are installed on your system: OpenCV, DeepFace,Python's built-in os module (comes pre-installed).
